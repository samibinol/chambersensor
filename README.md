# chambersensor
Simple chamber temperature sensor using an Arduino Uno and a BMP280 + LCD. I made this out of the need for chamber temp monitoring for more warp prone plastics in my P1S so that I can let the chamber heat up before starting a print.

Requirements: 
- Adafruit_Sensor
- Adafruit_BMP280
- LiquidCrystal_I2C
